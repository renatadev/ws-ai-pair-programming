# Kanban Board: Brief

### Overview

In this task, you, your teammate and your AI partners will build a collaborative Kanban board application. The goal is to create a local web app where users can manage tasks by adding, updating, and moving them between columns: "To Do", "Doing", and "Done".

### Core Features

1. **Static Board UI**:

- Three columns ("To Do", "Doing", "Done").
- UI components for board layout and task cards.

2. **Live Data Integration**:

- Use a database to store tasks.
- API endpoints for getting and updating tasks.
- UI updates dynamically from the database.

3. **Task Management**:

- Add new tasks via a form.
- Update task status (move between columns).
- Delete tasks.
- Data persistence in the database.

4. **Documentation**:

- Human-edited README and `CLAUDE.md` with project overview and key commands.

We will not be building in authentication or deployment in this project, so you don't have to plan for them.

### Success Criteria

A successful project will:

- Load tasks from the database and display them in the correct columns.
- Allow users to add, move, delete and complete tasks through the UI.
